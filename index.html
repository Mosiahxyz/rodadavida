        <p>This is not about how much you have but rather how you relate to money. There are some millionaires who worry
          themselves sick about money so might score very low here and others who have just enough to get by and simply
          go
          with the flow. A 10 is someone totally at ease with money whereas a 1 is someone so worried about money that
          it
          is
          creating huge stress and limiting them in all their actions.

        <p>People who are truly successful commit themselves continually to learning and improving themselves. Are you a
          10
          – committed to learning as much as you can about life? Are you constantly experiencing new opportunities? Do
          you
          regularly read to learn and grow? Are you open to improving and stretching yourself? The fact that you are
          reading
          this demonstrates a certain level of commitment to develop yourself so you are not a 1 or even a 2.

        <input id="inputHealth" type="range" min="0.1" max="1" step="0.1" value="1" oninput="adjustScale('health')" />
        <p>We all take our health for granted until it lets us down. How is yours? Do you look after yourself? Are you
          eating well? Do you get regular exercise? Having a long-term illness does not necessarily mean you need to
          give
          yourself a low score. The main thing is whether you are doing everything within your control to improve or
          regulate your condition.

        <h1>Family</h1>
        <input id="inputFamily" type="range" min="0.1" max="1" step="0.1" value="1" oninput="adjustScale('family')" />
        <p>Family life is very important. Although family life should be loving, caring and supportive it often is not
          for
          a
          variety of reasons such as crying babies, wild teenage sons or daughters or constant arguments and tension.
          These
          all represent a huge challenge and will affect other areas of your life like your work / studies,
          relationships
          and so on. In this respect family life to you could mean a single unit or a more extended family. Whatever
          family
          life means to you give yourself a current score

          oninput="adjustScale('relationships')" />
        <p>Consider the key relationship you have whether it is with your boyfriend/girlfriend husband/wife/friend or
          family
          member. Where do you feel it is at? Where would you like it to be?

        <h1>Social Life</h1>
        <input id="inputSocialLife" type="range" min="0.1" max="1" step="0.1" value="1"
          oninput="adjustScale('socialLife')" />
        <p>This can be about the quality of your social life which can score very low for people with busy careers.
          However
          you can also decide to score it based on how you interact with people as how often you get to socialise. A
          vital
          component of life is the need to get on and interact with people. How comfortable you are in social
          situations?
          Some people are the life and soul of every party, loved by all and fully confident yet sensitive whereas
          others
          will not want to speak up when there is a group of people around. Give yourself a score. Remember for this one
          that most 1s are locked up. so you can rule out that score.

          oninput="adjustScale('attitude')" />
        <p>Attitude is vital and can influence every aspect of your life. Is your glass half full or half empty? Are you
          a
          positive person who notices all the good things that happen and comes up with solutions when things don’t go
          as
          planned or do you always expect the worse and the worse always seems to happen?

        <h1>Career</h1>
        <input id="inputCareer" type="range" min="0.1" max="1" step="0.1" value="1" oninput="adjustScale('career')" />
        <p>How is your career going? We spend a lot of time working so how is it for you? Does it excite you? Have you a
          clear idea what it is you want to achieve? If you are not working are you happy you know what it is you want
          to
          do
          and are taking steps to achieve this? Are you a 1 – you feel physically sick before you go to work each
          morning
          (and not because you have been enjoying the festive season too much) or are you a 10 – would you do your job
          without being paid for it?

        <h1>Final Step</h1>
        <p>When you have scored all areas join the points on each section to draw a wheel. This will show you how
          balanced
          overall your life is and what areas you really need to focus on. Put a date on it and review it at least every
          6
          months.
